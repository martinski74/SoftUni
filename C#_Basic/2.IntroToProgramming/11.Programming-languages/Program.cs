             Java - Java is a computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented,
             * and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let
             * application developers "write once, run anywhere" (WORA), meaning that code that runs on one platform does
             * not need to be recompiled to run on another. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode (class file)
             * that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture. Java is, as of 2014, one of the
             * most popular programming languages in use, particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.
             * Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since merged into Oracle Corporation) and released in 1995 
             * as a core component of Sun Microsystems Java platform. The language derives much of its syntax from C and C++, but it has fewer low-level 
             * facilities than either of them.
2. C -  is a general-purpose programming language initially developed by Dennis Ritchie between 1969 and 1973 at
             * AT&T Bell Labs.Like most imperative languages in the ALGOL tradition, C has facilities for structured
             * programming and allows lexical variable scope and recursion, while a static type system prevents many
             * unintended operations. Its design provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions,
             * and therefore it has found lasting use in applications that had formerly been coded in assembly language, 
             * most notably system software like the Unix computer operating system. C is one of the most widely used 
             * programming languages of all time,and Compilers are available for the majority of available computer
             * architectures and operating systems.
3. C++ - is a general purpose programming language. It has imperative, object-oriented ànd generic programming features,
             * while also providing the facilities for low level memory manipulation. It is designed with a bias for systems
             * programming (e.g. embedded systems, operating system kernels), with performance, efficiency and flexibility
             * of use as its design requirements. C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts, including desktop 
             * applications, servers (e.g. e-commerce, web search, SQL), performance critical applications (e.g. telephone 
             * switches, space probes) and entertainment software, such as video games. It is a compiled language, with implementations
             * of it available on many platforms. Various organizations provide them, including the FSF, LLVM, Microsoft and Intel.
4. C# - s a multi-paradigm programming language encompassing strong typing, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, 
             * object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines. It was developed by Microsoft 
             * within its .NET initiative and later approved as a standard by Ecma (ECMA-334) and ISO (ISO/IEC 23270:2006). 
             * C# is one of the programming languages designed for the Common Language Infrastructure. C# is intended to be a
             * simple, modern, general-purpose, object-oriented programming language. Its development team is led by Anders Hejlsberg.
             * The most recent version is C# 5.0, which was released on August 15, 2012.

Simular to C# languages is Java, C, C++ because all of these language are object-oriented (class-based). All of these language are verry popular. Difference between C# and Java is that C# is multi-paradigm programming language. Java is derives much of its syntax from C and C++.
